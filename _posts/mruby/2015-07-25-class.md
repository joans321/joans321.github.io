# Basic Object

Every thing in mruby are object and refer to its singleton class.
anti-class have singleton class and super class.
class also have singleton class and super class.

Almost every object has its owner singleton class, except `true, false, symbol, fixnum and float`.
Objects have some basic types :

* True
* False equal to nil
* Free
* Fix Number
* Symbol
* Undef
* Float
* CPTR 
* Object
* Class
* Module
* Include Class
* Sington Class
* Proc
* Arrasy
* Hash
* String
* Range
* Exception
* File
* Data
* Fiber


All class has its super class and *BasicObject* is the orignal class.
The basic class superclass and singleton class chain :

BasicObject --> BasicOjbect singleton class 
   ^                 ^
   |                 |
 Object --> Object singleton class
   ^                 ^
   |                 |
 Module --> Module singleton class
   ^            ^
   |            |
 Class  --> Class singleton class
   ^
   |
 SubClass -->  Subclass singleton class
   ^
   |<----------------------
                          |
 real object --> object singleton class


The basic class singleton class chain :

Class <--- BasicObject
